### Hi there 👋


**TratonGossink/TratonGossink** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🛠️ I’m currently working on my own Grocery Gets app using SwiftData. This app is to serve as a checklist style app with expanding list features to keep things clean and straight to the point.  Even though many people are not using SwiftData yet, I am still excited to dive into new advancements in Swift to gain insight and experience. 
- 🌱 I am currently learning more about ARKit. I think this will have more use cases as the future of VR progresses.
